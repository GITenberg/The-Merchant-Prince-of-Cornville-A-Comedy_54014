<h2><a name="PREFACE_TO_THE_FOURTH_EDITION" id="PREFACE_TO_THE_FOURTH_EDITION"></a>PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.</h2>

<p>Prompted by the interest which has arisen since the publication of
former editions of this comedy, the author takes occasion to state that
“The Merchant Prince of Cornville” was written between the years 1875
and 1879. It was circulated and read in manuscript copies until 1895,
when, at the request of many persons, it was placed in the hands of the
printers for publication in book form, from whom printed proofs were
received in July, of that year. In 1896 the first edition appeared in
print from the University Press of Cambridge. In the same year it was
given a single representation at the Novelty Theater, London, with the
object only of securing the acting rights in England.</p>

<p>One of the purposes of the author is to present the poetic and ideal in
dramatic contrast with the materialistic and commonplace spirit, which,
perhaps, somewhat more strongly than to-day, prevailed two decades ago,
when this comedy was completed; the underlying theme intended to be
developed being that the love of a high-minded and refined woman can be
gained only by appealing to her poetic fancy and finer sensibilities.
How well the objects sought have been attained is left to the judgment
of the reader.</p>

<span class="i0">The hour of dawn!&mdash;how thrilling and intense!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The matin songs of birds, that dart and soar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On quivering wings, now break upon the sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As sharply as the cannon’s voice at mid-day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In yonder wood that guards the sea-cliff’s wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where sullen shadows shrink away and flee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the rising sun’s advancing spears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The day-detesting owl hath turned his back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto the light, and sought the sheltering cowl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ivy web about the oak-tree thrown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the glowing world,&mdash;wood, sea, and sky,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is most sublimely beautiful beneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This pendulous light, that, like an avalanche<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of golden beams.... But I have spoken the word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That halts my fancy’s flight, and brings me back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To earth and its dull cares, and our dull age,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10"></a>{10}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our golden age ’tis called: our age of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard and material, when our best ideals<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But folly seem, all things are bought and sold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even love itself is merchandise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! the many years that I have known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many ills, in this same golden age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have brought their bitter harvest to my breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like frozen grain beaten by winds unkind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From out the icy north; but as those seeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fall sterile on the earth, nor glow with life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shall my sorrows take no living root<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within my bosom.... Now do I recall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a sweet picture in a gallery hung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How I last eve at early twilight watched<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The figure of a lovely maiden bending<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tenderly o’er a vase of new-blown flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a breezy terrace, underneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A green-hued lattice-work, that, like a shield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Embossed with morning-glories, hides and guards<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her chamber window. Passing there this morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I looked upon the flowers as one might<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, barred from out the walls of Paradise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would seize some blossom growing sweetly there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, while my eager heart tumultuous beat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sending the tell-tale blushes to my cheek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I plucked a flower&mdash;this crimson, perfumed pink.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis woven from a clod of earth, and yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me ’tis fairer than a star of heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet flower! sweet flower! last evening I did see<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11"></a>{11}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy mistress from her chamber casement lean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gaze ecstatic on the pilgrim moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tracing a silvery path along the sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou didst woo her from that magic gaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drawing her to thee with the subtler force<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of finer particles than live within<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cold moon’s slanting beams....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But soft! yonder my lady’s self appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slow moving down the orchard path. I’ll seek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A covert by this tree. Seeing the hunter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doth fright the deer away.<br /></span>

<p>I thought I heard some one speak, but not from underground, for he’s not
a goblin; nor yet from the sky, for he’s not an angel; nor yet from the
earth, for no dreadful man is near. Why, what is that in the sky? ’Tis
last eve’s moon, that will not to her couch by day. To rest! pale
planet. O gentle moon, where is thy blush? Thou art<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12"></a>{12}</span> dismantled by the

<span class="i0">Are gentle as the velvet fawns that glide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From out thy rustling groves. In thee, rare flowers<br /></span>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>But list; what’s this? A spirit in the tree,&mdash;a talking spirit, too!

the tree’s rind too hard? I do pity thee for a poor spirit.</p>

<p>Nay, hear me. When the tree is in its blossom, then rhymes come
fleetest; when the tree is in its fruitage, then rhymes come sweetest.
Thou once, on such a time, didst sit beneath these ripening boughs, in
sweetest reverie wrapt, and I, while musing on thy beauty and the gentle
spirit within thee, did weave these rhymes.</p>

What spirit art thou in man’s disguise to thus affright a lady who ne’er
did harm to thee, but wished thee well? How couldst thou treat me so?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Ideal.</span></p>

<p>Fair maid, thou fill’st me with such keen delight I know not what to
say, but pause for utterance, my lips being newly laden with a sweet
burden.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Nay, not so. Thou art too literal. I do entreat thee for an answer.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Ideal.</span></p>

<p>Thou art the most fair complainant that e’er did sue for answer, and in
a just cause, too. How could the earth resist the sun? How could the sea
resist the tide? How could a spirit resist heaven?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I thought thou wert a spirit who’d been in heaven long ago.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Ideal.</span></p>

<p>Never before did I even dream of heaven; and for material answer make I
this: Our spirits were kindred, and by that fair relationship I did

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Now do I know thee: thou art no spirit, but a robber,&mdash;a substantial
robber who plucked my favorite pink from my window; but I, rising in
quick haste, followed thee adown this orchard path. Thou thought’st thou
hadst escaped me. I did see thee but half plainly, by the dawn’s most
timorous light that through the lattice wooed my pillow.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Ideal.</span></p>

<p>As thou didst wake! Oh, would I were the dawn’s most delicate light that
wooed thy soul’s fair stars exiled within thy crescent-curtained eyes!</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>And if thou wert, thou wert but a robber still. Thou hast the flower in
thy hand!</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Ideal.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I have treasured it; yet will I return to thee the pink. ’Tis thy
property.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Nay, keep the flower, if thou lovest it so.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Ideal.</span></p>

<p>Ay, then I’ll think it had its birth ’neath twilight’s violet sky.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Think not too lightly of the flower; ’tis most rare,&mdash;grown from a seed
found in the tomb of an Egyptian<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18" id="page_18"></a>{18}</span> mummy. She was an ancient princess who
died in the flower of her youth from love ill requited: so reads the
antique parchment entombed with her,&mdash;a legend pitiful and true; but
then, ’twas three thousand years ago.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Ideal.</span></p>

<p>Love has grown more constant since then.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I hope thou wouldst not jest at love?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Ideal.</span></p>

<p>Nay, not I. I’d sooner jest at all fair properties in heaven and earth
than jest at love.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>’Tis a flower of ancient lineage. I planted it with mine own hands, and
watched it grow. What joy I felt to see it grow, I ne’er can tell. When
first its tender bud beseeched the sky, it was athirst; I brought it
water from a crystal spring. From simple bud to leafy stalk it grew, and
then the petals formed, giving sweet promise of a flower; till
yesternight from its green husk the perfect blossom bloomed, and I did
shed a tear upon it, thinking of that poor princess.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Ideal.</span></p>

<p>Dost think her spirit lives in heaven?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19"></a>{19}</span></p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>That do I most truly. I would not that thou thought’st differently. Thou
couldst not be so cruel!</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Ideal.</span></p>

<p>Thy simple story moves me beyond the power of prayer. Now that the
flower buried with her doth live, let it bequeath a legacy of love most
true and constant to our hearts; so shall the princess from beyond see
within our lives a perfect love wrought by her most heavenly agency. And
here [<i>kneeling</i>], on bended knee, by thy dear hand that’s clasped in
mine, I vow, by all the subtle bonds that nature placed within the world
to bind us to the truth, to love thee ever.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Rise; thou art the planet of my maiden firmament. I do believe thee. My
vow is linked with thine most sweetly and inseparably.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Ideal.</span></p>

<p>Thy words are bright flowers, whose subtle sweets I do extract and hide
away. Ay, I shall live on them when thou art absent, as the patient bee
lives on his hoarded store in winter.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I hope thou speakest truly as thou dost fairly, for thou speakest as a
poet doth, and I have heard,&mdash;but pardon me; I’ll not quote the idle
gossip.</p>

<p>Well, then, to heed thy prayer. I’ve heard it rumored that poets, in
their grammar, all the moods of love do conjugate in swift succession.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Ideal.</span></p>

<p>I’ll prove to thee that gossip is untrue.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I’ve heard that they are variable; that they contract the four seasons
into the compass of a day,&mdash;call the morning spring, the forenoon
summer, the afternoon autumn, and the evening oft the depth of winter;
that they in idle ways say thus: Why, prithee, this forenoon, being in
love beneath the equator, I felt the fervent sun impart his fever to the
earth; but to-night, alack! being out of love, Lapland hath no denizen
colder than I. I pray thou wilt not treat me so.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Ideal.</span></p>

<p>By Heaven, ’tis a scandal! I’d have thee try me. Use pique, jest,
coldness, stratagem, and all the dire weapons in a maid’s armory to try
her lover, and if, knowing thou art true, I do not in all love’s humors
love thee still, why then&mdash;</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Yes, why then&mdash;</p>

<p>I’ll be precise, and timely guard my answer. ’Tis nigh unto five
o’clock; the minute-hand lacks one, the second-hand&mdash;</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Stop, stop! thou outspeedest Time himself. How desperately thou rushest
from the hour to the minute hand&mdash;from thence there is but a fraction of
time to the second hand, which I take to be not a good token; for thou
hadst but a minute ago my hand, and yet thus swiftly thou wouldst
approach a second hand.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Ideal.</span></p>

<p>Shall we have no watches with second hands?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>I’ll have no merchandising. Thou a poet and a lover, and lookest at thy
watch to tell the sun’s height! Alas! put up thy watch; lovers do not
time themselves by watches. Thou wouldst not so at night register the
moon’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22"></a>{22}</span> height; but upon a pressing question, How high’s the moon?
wouldst answer, A little higher than yonder rose-bush, if the moon rose
late; or, perchance, A little higher than yonder tree-top, if the moon
rose early. The sun’s as fine to me by day as the moon by night. Poetry
doth not steal away at dawn of day. But thou must go; good-by for a

<p>As fair spoken a robbery as e’er the sun shone upon. A fair and gallant
robber, too, who robs me of my heart in broad daylight, detected in the

ne’er again detect so fine a robber. Who’s he? What’s he? I know not, I

<p>Hercules Whetstone, patron of the arts and sciences, founder and
president of the Cornville Academy as a paying investment, and nourisher
of its infant civilization, proprietor of the Cornville Eagle&mdash;</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>One moment, Major Bluegrass: that will do for the home market, but not
among strangers. I’ve given you both a summer vacation, so that you may
enjoy yourselves, and work harder when you return. Now, look around,
store up knowledge, and&mdash;I won’t deduct the time from your salaries.
That’s business. But you must be more particular about my titles. Always
speak of me to strangers as the Honorable Mayor Hercules Whetstone, the
Merchant Prince of Cornville, near the capital of Illinois,&mdash;called
Hercules after his grand-uncle Hercules, who drove the Indians down the
Mississippi. Do you follow me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bluegrass</span>, <span class="smcap">Scythe</span>.</p>

<p>We do.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>Oh, why was I so long pent up in the heart of a continent? I can remain
on land no longer.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe</span> [<i>taking out his note-book and writing</i>].</p>

<p>Item,&mdash;this is important. Major Bluegrass, long pent up in the heart of
the American continent, upon his first<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33" id="page_33"></a>{33}</span> sight of the sea wishes to swim.
This is of great scientific value, as it shows the recurrence, after
long deprivation, of an inherited pre-Adamite instinct; for we read that
Adam walked, but never that he swam, therefore are we driven to the
waters for evidence. It proves the origin of man from the oyster, or
some more ancient inhabitant of the sea.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>I am no fish, nor ever was. I’d rather spring from a rainbow than a
pond.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe.</span></p>

<p>A pond is your rainbow come to earth.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>I must swim. Oh, Mayor Whetstone, let us all swim!</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe</span> [<i>writing in his note-book</i>].</p>

<p>The pre-Adamite instinct in the presence of its primary environment
manifests increasing ratio.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>Professor, take your increasing ratio and slide down to the imponderable
roots of the sea. I must get out of this prison of clothes, and into the
water.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Major, try to feel comfortable with your clothes on, for you’d soon be
imprisoned without them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_34" id="page_34"></a>{34}</span></p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>No dungeon of clothes can hold me! What a lofty repose comes over me as
I survey yon glittering expanse of water, like a blue field of
undulating velvet! A tear of joy I give to thee, O mighty sea!</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe</span> [<i>writing in his note-book</i>].</p>

<p>Item,&mdash;he returns a saline tear to the sea, in memory of his pre-Adamite
ancestor. This is the pre-Raphaelism of natural selection.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>You are my scientist, my threefold Professor of three chairs,&mdash;natural
science, hygiene, and agriculture,&mdash;in my Cornville Academy. Now, to
create a money-making hunger for science at the Academy we must
popularize it. Therefore, give me the scientific facts about the sea in
a popular sort of way, so that all may understand and enjoy them.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe.</span></p>

<p>Its remote abysses are inhabited by the mammoths of natural history and
evolutionary philosophy; and vast herds of sea-cattle graze upon its
marine meadows, like buffaloes upon the prairies. In fact, our prairies
were once the bottom of the sea, and the buffaloes were supposed to have
been left when the waters receded.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>Your marine buffaloes must wear anchors around their necks, instead of
cow-bells.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_35" id="page_35"></a>{35}</span></p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe.</span></p>

<p>Not so. Nature always provides for her creatures; for, as birds soaring
above the mountain-tops have great wings of feathers, so, on the other
hand, these cattle have immense hoofs, of a substance resembling lead,
but much heavier than the lead of commerce.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>That adds to their commercial value. Major Bluegrass, you’re my private
secretary, and editor of my Cornville Eagle: what do you know about the
sea?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>I only know what I want to see: I want to see the sport the mermaids see
down in their prismatic sea homes, drinking out of beautiful sea-shells,
while pearls drop at their iridescent feet. Oh, Hercules Whetstone, you
are rich! Get me a diving-bell. I’ll interview the mermaids for the
benefit of the Eagle, scoop our rival, the Hawkeye Observer, and send up
the Eagle’s circulation ten thousand.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Blue thunder, Major, be calm! Ever since we arrived here you’ve been as
excited as if you expected to see a drove of fairies and hobgoblins jump
out of every bush and dance in the air.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe.</span></p>

<p>He may have caught the infection of the season: for it is now the
so-called fairies’ season of drolleries and bewitchments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_36" id="page_36"></a>{36}</span> It was a
delusion of the ancients, and yet it had some scientific basis,&mdash;for
science shows that this full summer tide heightens and ripens the
natural dispositions of men, so that what is most natural in them often
seems most strange.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

I am slugged by an iron bolus from the hands of my friends. This is

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe.</span></p>

<p>Among domestic cattle, vast droves of sea-pigs&mdash;in our inland

boils, before a storm; and sea-calves, sea-cows, and sea-oxen roam its

my love. Professor, how should a man dress to be a so-called lover?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe.</span></p>

<p>That depends; but this is true: He that loves is like a traveller

<p>What an explanation! [<i>laughing</i>] ha-ha-ha!</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Professor, what is the laugh?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe.</span></p>

<p>My analysis of the laugh is not yet completed, and I am now seeking to
produce the missing link. However, the juxtaposition of two incongruous
yet contemporaneous images in the mind is simultaneous with contrasting
and varying pressures upon the electrically charged nerves. These
varying pressures by reflex action cause the pleasurable action of the
muscles called the laugh. Let me illustrate. By varying and alternating
pressures upon the electrically charged nerves of the eye there is
presented to the mind the image of a lover caressing a maiden; and just
beyond, the one view overlapping the other, we see a donkey eating the
lover’s bouquet, and then [<i>laughing</i>] ha&mdash;ha&mdash;ha!</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>The donkey took the bouquet for an offering of beau’s hay.</p>

<p>Attention! We’re now in science.</p>

<p>It is the most refrangible of the seven primary colors of the solar

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe.</span></p>

<p>Let me illustrate. You discover by a violet light a beautiful fish in
the water, and you wish to catch it. Now, you must throw your hook,
dart, or net, not directly at it, but a considerable space this side,
according to the depth.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>That’s fishing under difficulties. Do you mean to say that a man can’t

<p>I know! let me explain.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Listen to the Professor!</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe.</span></p>

<p>Violet light passing from one medium into another of a different density
becomes most refractory, and turned out of a direct course at an angle:
in other words, you must angle for your fish. See my Tables on Molecular
Structure, Density, etc., determined by angles of refraction.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>So if I get the hang of the angles and depth, I’m all right, am I?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_44" id="page_44"></a>{44}</span></p>

<p>Oh, ho! then I’m pretty well posted on Violet. Now for the next point:
Professor, what is love?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe.</span></p>

<p>With the passionless precision of science, I say unto you, Mayor
Whetstone, though she you love is the most symmetrical duplex pyramidal
aggregation of atoms in the human saccharine conglomeration, shun love,
and court science; for by spectroscopic analysis of the light proceeding
from the eyes of jealous lovers, I have seen their spleen turning a dark
green.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>I didn’t know it was so bad as that! Major, how do you regard love, from
the heights of romance?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>A region of enchantment.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Yonder valley with verdure clothed would be a capital place for my
emporium for porpoises, or so-called sea-pigs.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>I implore you, Mayor Whetstone, do not project across<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_45" id="page_45"></a>{45}</span> my mental line of
sight that animal, either in its terrestrial or marine form.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>He fills his destiny to the full; and besides, he is the most
intelligent of animals. It is a historical fact that he was taught to
play whist fifty years before the clever dog.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>He jars on the landscape, and is a discord amidst the dulcet harmony of
the waves.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>What would you have? The good pig eats all he can while he can;
therefore he eats like a pig. Major Bluegrass, let me hear no more of
your disparaging comments on the honest and assiduous pig,&mdash;the most
useful and business-like of all our domestic animals. He can nobly hold
up his head and represent corn converted. And while he turns the
cornfields into bank-notes, shall we blame him if he does not serenade
us with the notes of a silver flute?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe.</span></p>

<p>I wish to make a moral observation upon a physical basis: Major, if the
formula of your destiny were identical with the pig’s, you would give
rise to more discordant vocalization than even that disgruntled animal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_46" id="page_46"></a>{46}</span></p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>He may be the most useful animal upon this magnificent star of ours; but
though his good points were as many as his bristles, they could not
excuse his shortcomings. The limited geographical prospects of his pen
should make him deeply contemplative of the stars; instead of which he
roots deeply in the earth. Hence he takes a step backwards, and, instead
of increasing his wit, he increases only his weight.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe.</span></p>

<p>Man is like a reversed vegetable that has swallowed its roots and walked
off on its branches. Why, what is that at my feet? Let me pick it up

<p class="c"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Catharine</span> <i>in disguise, with a basket of fish</i>.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Catharine.</span></p>

<p>Good afternoon, gentlemen landsmen! I have fish in my basket; will you
buy? I have your fortunes in my keeping; will you have them?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>I salute you, by the sea, as a near relative in the fields of romance to
the milking-maid of our inland pastures.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Catharine.</span></p>

<p>I take you to be landsmen, and, therefore, good fresh men. I am a
fortune-teller with varied fortunes. Each summer, for a month, to these
shores I come to renew and perfect the spirit’s vision, which, even like
natural sight, is cleared by good free air and sunshine; and as men with
glasses have seen ten hundred living things upon a pin’s point, so I,
with spiritual lenses, have seen the past, present, and future, each in
proper order, marshalled upon a space no larger than a spectacle glass.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Pardon me,&mdash;your name and home?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Catharine.</span></p>

<p>My name is Catharine, and my home is wherever I am. I come from the
city, where there are more sharks in one day than you will see here in a
year, and where people in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_50" id="page_50"></a>{50}</span> despair come to me for the fortune fate has
denied them. I am more pitiful than fate; and their pleased looks give
me a joy greater than does their pittance. Hence, poor souls, I give
them precious pictures of future good, which, believing in, they
achieve, and thus their griefs assuage.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>We all, to-day, bear our fortunes lightly.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Catharine.</span></p>

<p>And may you at nightfall bear them as lightly! Fine weather makes quick
friends. Come, then, gentlemen, will you buy? Each one in his own humor.
If there be a true merchant among you, I will tempt him with the fish’s
weight; if there be a moralist, with the fish’s moral; if there be a
scientist, with the fish’s complicated structure; if there be a poet,
with the fish’s most poetical history; if there be a gourmand, with the
fish’s flavor. Each one shall see in the fish he buys, his own humor. He
shall have both weight and moral; for a good moral without weight is
immoral, and a good weight without a good moral is a dull measure. You
shall pay me for the weight, for that the fish had in the sea; but for
the moral, that is in my humor, and gain has taken a vacation. Every one
has his pastime, and no one is so poor but he has his humor. Mine is to
see men buy a fish, each in his own humor; for by the fish’s scales will
I weigh him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_51" id="page_51"></a>{51}</span></p>

<p>With losing of my husband, and giving of good fortunes. But come,
gentlemen; fair weather makes quick friends, but unfair questions, like
unfair weather, part them. Will you buy?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>Let us buy.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Let us first learn the price of the fish.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>It sounds to me like a romance. Come, let us all sit here in pleasant
converse; the night is afar, and while we buy we’ll enjoy the aroma of
the salt-sea zephyrs blown from off the invisible flower-beds of the

<p>Stop your perpetual romance!</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>Romance that is not perpetual, but goes by fits and starts, is not worth
the reality it feeds upon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_52" id="page_52"></a>{52}</span></p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>Hercules Whetstone, Mayor of Cornville, there are some things upon this
magnificent star of ours that are not in the market,&mdash;things so high
that you cannot reach and put a price upon them in the cold-blooded
shambles of merchandise.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>There you go again, trying to throw star-dust in your benefactor’s eyes.
Oh, why did I make you editor of my Cornville Eagle?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>Because your Eagle was asleep, and I was the only one who could wake him
up and make him soar into a higher circulation. He looked like a whipped
buzzard that had dulled his talons upon old newspapers; but I put new
life into him; and now that I have made you the proprietor of a
newspaper which is a household word, and which will be in every
scholar’s library at the close of human learning, you scoff at me. Such
is glory in a commercial age! Columbus may discover, but the merchant
Americus gives his name to two continents.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe.</span></p>

<p>Good woman, some undesirable chemical change may take<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_53" id="page_53"></a>{53}</span> place in your
fish. I would advise you to put some salt on them. I am a chemist.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Catharine.</span></p>

<p>The fish are dead; they cannot hear.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe.</span></p>

<p>Mayor Whetstone, why do you not change the Eagle to the Hawkeye Review
of Western Science?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>Strip that proud bird of his plumage, and in less than seven revolutions
of this magnificent star of ours he will have fewer followers than a
vanquished rooster.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Major, I cannot resist you. You are my true, my great and only editor.
Give me your hand; let us be friends.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>Now let us go on with our romance. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Catharine</span>.] Bring on your fish!</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Catharine.</span></p>

<p>There are as queer fish inside as outside the basket, I’ll warrant you.
[<i>She presents the basket to</i> <span class="smcap">Whetstone</span>; <i>he selects a codfish</i>.] That
is a fish in weight and look of much import,&mdash;the codfish. He is an
aristocrat among the shoals and schools, and he has done much to build
up our own<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_54" id="page_54"></a>{54}</span> aristocracy. [<i>She presents the basket to</i> <span class="smcap">Scythe</span>, <i>and he
selects a Holothurian</i>.]</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe.</span></p>

<p>Why, madam, this is a rare fish, a Holothurian, vulgarly called a
sea-cucumber, from its resemblance to that common garden vegetable. I’ll
mount its skeleton at once. It is the fish of science, and has the power
of analysis; for ’tis written that when attacked, for self-protection it
will divide itself into many pieces, or turn itself inside out.</p>

<p><i>She presents the basket to</i> <span class="smcap">Bluegrass</span>, <i>and he selects a flying-fish</i>.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>How beautiful!</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Catharine.</span></p>

<p>Yes, ’tis a flying-fish, which, rising above the heavy and obscurer
element of its kind, and using its fins as wings, in aërial courses,
sparkling like a jewel, beholds the glittering and sunlit scenery of the
upper air. There is much similarity between these excursions and the
poet’s fancies. And as these lower creatures in their airy flights
excite the wonderment of fishes and please men, so may human excursions
in the higher element of fancy excite the wonderment of men and please
the gods.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass</span> [<i>in admiration</i>].</p>

<p>Madam, consider yourself engaged as sea-side correspondent of the
Cornville Eagle: topic, sea-fish and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_55" id="page_55"></a>{55}</span> morals. Please accept my

<p>Item,&mdash;this is important. In evolution, the grasshopper sprang from the
flying-fish.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>What birds are those flying above the waves and darting like flying
squirrels?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Catharine.</span></p>

<p>They are the larks of the sea, and in the wake of a ship are wider awake
than your land larks.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>Madam, with your permission,&mdash;upon the first streak of dawn our common
meadow-lark has been known to climb the heavenly vaults above this
magnificent star of ours like a morning-glory of song.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Professor Scythe, explain.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe</span> [<i>examining the birds with his glass</i>].</p>

<p>Leaving, for a moment, grave mysteries of the deep upon the floor of the
abysmal sea, we ascend to trace in the flight of a simple bird its name
and family. The wings of the bird<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_56" id="page_56"></a>{56}</span> are the pre-Adamite forefeet of an
animal which, through ceaseless efforts of evolution, became crowned
with feathers. From the movements of these feathered forefeet we can
tell all about the bird. Now, Mayor Whetstone, take this glass. [<i>He
gives glass to</i> <span class="smcap">Whetstone</span>, <i>who follows the movements of the bird with
it</i>.] Now watch closely the parabola of dip or curve of flight that puts
it in the great family of web-footed water-fowls. See the unwavering
scoop, the practiced and web-footed ease with which it grazes a wave. We
have before us a genuine sea-gull.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>What a monster! [<i>Observing the lobster.</i>] Professor, what’s his

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe</span> [<i>weariedly</i>].</p>

<p>I don’t know.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Don’t know! Professor, it cost me a heap of money to build my nursery of
learning, the Cornville Academy, and I’m going to make it the biggest
paying institution on this broad continent. I’ve advertised you in
letters big as fence-posts as our own prided prince of science, engaged
at an enormous salary. There are already applications for next term from
over five hundred anxious fathers of wonderful sons. Can I afford to
disappoint them? No. Can you stand there and calmly tell me you cannot
give me so simple a thing as the history of a deep-sea flea?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe</span> [<i>looking at lobster with his glass</i>].</p>

<p>In the race for life, he first made his appearance in the epoch of the
mammoth, anterior to the gigantic antediluvians, before the apparition
of man upon the earth, and at a season in the progressive series of
pre-Adamite evolution soon after the separation of the crocodile branch
from the main stem, about forty-five millions of years ago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_58" id="page_58"></a>{58}</span></p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Astonishing! so long as that?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe.</span></p>

<p>I will not in detail give his scientific biography. It is sufficient
that during this period he gorged himself with the blood of these
primeval mammoths, which accounts for his size, and often, frenzied by
the harrowing appetite of this parasite, these gigantic and prehistoric
brutes made the primeval forests for a hundred miles ring with their
helpless bellowings. But I will not further excite your pity for the
remote ages.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Go on, Professor, go on!</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe.</span></p>

<p>This was the summer of his race; but, alas! then came the glacial
period. He was frozen up with the mammoths, and remained so for probably
twenty millions of years; but such was his tenacity of life, that when
the world thawed out, he again appeared, his skin somewhat hardened by
exposure,&mdash;a fact which you will recognize,&mdash;but otherwise cheerful, and
in his usual health. Well may his kind be grateful; for, wrapped in ice
for æons of time, he was the slender thread upon which their future
hung.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>But why did he take to the sea?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_59" id="page_59"></a>{59}</span></p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe.</span></p>

<p>After the apparition of man upon the earth he was driven into the sea by
the excited inhabitants.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Major, this is truly wonderful. The Academy will succeed.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>’Tis the very romance of science.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>But, Professor, what was the glacial period?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe.</span></p>

<p>Well, sir, the glacial period was an epoch when, from a business point
of view, ice was cheaper than dirt. Had the apparition then occurred,
man could have gone all over the globe on skates. But as it was a vast
ball of ice, he would probably have slipped off into space, and nothing
more would have been heard of him. And so this star of ice for countless
ages rolled on through the sky like a big snow-ball; but at last the
great electric sun struck the earth on the equator, which accounts for
the equatorial bulge which exists to this day. Then commenced the
greatest drama of the elements ever witnessed upon our planet. The vast
ice-fields were riven in twain, with terrific reports which reverberated
through the heavenly spaces, and to which our present thunder is but as
an elemental whisper. Icebergs formed, and in fantastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_60" id="page_60"></a>{60}</span> and sublime
shapes, towering mountain high and illuminated by the sun, floated down
towards the equator.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Go on, don’t stop; go on.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe.</span></p>

<p>Then commenced the great oscillation of the land-masses; then the
eruptive rocks and sedimentary strata were moved from their foundations.
Then occurred the geologic epoch of the denudation and washdown of hills
and mountains, and then were formed the ocean floors, the islands, and
the continental areas which we inhabit.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

I asked him, What’s that book? He replied, It’s a work on speculative
philosophy. Said I, Throw it away, and study the market quotations and
crops; that’s the kind of speculative philosophy you need.</p>

<p>Mine friend, we were born twins; our own father couldn’t tell us apart.</p>

<p>Peter Punch Number Two. We are twins; I swears it. Mine friends, these
are my beautiful suits; and in this bottle<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_67" id="page_67"></a>{67}</span> is the wonder of seven
hemispheres, the sublimely famous and justly celebrated unk-weed
liniment. By your firesides, rub it in well. With one wing of medicinal
gum, and the other of healing balsam, it flies to its proud home in the
bones. Gentlemens, rub it in well. There it works its marvels. This,
gentlemens, is the unk-weed art gallery [<i>pointing to two pictures</i>].
This one is before taking; that one, after taking. Gentlemens, rub it on
your skins inside, and put one of my suits on the outside, and then you
do marvels. I swears it.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Which do you sell or rent,&mdash;the suits, or the liniment? [<span class="smcap">Punch</span> <i>winks an

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Punch.</span></p>

<p>Goodness gracious! you surprises me so. Mine eyelid slips down.
Gentlemens, I cannot rent the wonderful unk-weed.</p>

<p>Peter Punch, you are a compound fraction. Give your doctor fraction a
quick drop, and your tailor fraction a fresh seaming. We have good sound
characters, but you and your tailor’s goose may mend them. I wish to
cast upon a French maid a romantic spell, something in the aurora

<p>Mine friend, it is my little weakness. I swears it.</p>

<p>Try to keep your blind up. It makes me suspicious that something wrong
is going on inside. Peter, have you a rainbow suit?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Punch.</span></p>

<p>Mine dear friend, I’ve just what will suit you. I made it for a

him a mask</i>.] Why, it has a nose upon it like a barn-gable.</p>

<p>Mine friend, a big nose makes a strong character [<i>laying his finger

<p>Come out from under your disguise, Peter <span class="smcap">Punch.</span> You have the eternal

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Punch.</span></p>

<p>I thank you, gentlemens.</p>

<p>Do you think you can take my measure for a suitable character suit with
your puny tape-line? Put up your line, and search Flatpuddle Smith’s
Biography of Great Men,&mdash;although I must say there are in that book some
of the biggest measures of the littlest men on earth; and besides, old
Heavyweight, who made his fortune putting sand in sugar, is on the first
page. They asked for sugar, and he sandpapered them. It’ll go rough with
him. Peter Punch, listen to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_70" id="page_70"></a>{70}</span> measure. I’m a merchant prince, Mayor
Whetstone, from Cornville, near the capital of Illinois, called Hercules

Mississippi.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Punch</span> [<i>presenting a robe</i>].</p>

<p>This is the robe that Julius Cæsar wore when he did thrice refuse the

<p>Why did he refuse it? Didn’t it fit him? I don’t want that.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Punch</span> [<i>presenting a suit</i>].</p>

<p>This is a suit worn by a shepherd boy as he tends his flocks,&mdash;young

<p>Confound you! Do you think I want to be a shepherd boy, and herd sheep?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Punch</span> [<i>presenting another suit</i>].</p>

<p>This is the suit of a Highlander.</p>

<p>That’s high-sounding. Let me see it. What’s this?</p>

<p>Goodness gracious! you surprises me so. But here, mine friend. This is a

one day.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Why didn’t they stop him, the old villain? Peter Punch, you may as well

<p>Wait, wait, mine dear friend; I have a beautiful suit of armor,

of a grand knight-errant. [<i>Takes covering from mounted suit of armor.</i>]</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Ah, that’s something like the thing. The business we are on is a sort of

night?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_72" id="page_72"></a>{72}</span></p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Punch.</span></p>

<p>Mine friend, you is mistaken. The knight-errant was a great man who went
around foreign countries clad in a suit of mail, rescuing beautiful
damsels, over seven hundred years ago.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>So long ago as that? His clothes must be a little rusty; but you can rub
them well. You don’t say the suit is seven hundred years old?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Punch.</span></p>

<p>Over seven hundred years, mine friend [<i>winking</i>].</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Major, what would they say if they knew of this in Cornville? So the old
rascal used to go around in the night, rescuing beautiful damsels; and
they called them night errands! Didn’t he rescue the ugly damsels too?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Punch.</span></p>

<p>History is silent, mine friend.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Well, I do declare! I’ll keep up his trade. I’ll build up the old
industry on these shores, and I’ll make it hum.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Punch.</span></p>

<p>I have English, French, Spanish, and other cheaper kinds; but I’ll give
you the suit of a grand German knight-errant, because he was a great
Teuton.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_73" id="page_73"></a>{73}</span></p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>What is the rent to-night for the so-called Teuton knight-errant?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Punch.</span></p>

<p>You shall have him cheap. I will calculate. One cent a year, one dollar
for each hundred years,&mdash;seven dollars, mine friend.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Isn’t that tooting it rather high for a night errand?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Punch.</span></p>

<p>Mine friend, the Teuton knight-errant was the most substantial and
high-toned.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Substantial and high-toned! I’ll invest. I’ll wake up your old Teuton

<p>What shell?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Jack.</span></p>

<p>By Jove, you’re a ferocious ape. I’ll have you arrested. Ho, there! Oh,
policeman, come at once, I pray you, and quell this riot. Come, I
command you. But he don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_75" id="page_75"></a>{75}</span> come. What an abominable government we do

Then, you know, I’d go to court; then I’d be My Lord Fopdoodle. Oh, I’d

<p>What would you do if an enemy arose?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Fopdoodle.</span></p>

<p>Why, then the king would say: Upon the breeze that blows upon the
borders of my land, I sniff the enemy. My lord, my good and trusty Lord
Fopdoodle, hasten. Gather two hundred thousand men or so of our
confiding yeomanry and stanchest citizens. Go put the enemy down.&mdash;And I
would do it.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Jack.</span></p>

<p>But suppose he wouldn’t stay down?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Fopdoodle.</span></p>

<p>How would you raise the cash?</p>

<p>If I saw the treasury running low, I’d rise and thus address the throne
of majesty: Of late, most able king, thy servant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_76" id="page_76"></a>{76}</span> Lord Fopdoodle, whom
thou hast ennobled, hath observed sundry of his former friends,
shopkeepers, swelling with wealth and aping his nobility. I’ll strip
them of their towering ambition by taking off the goods from their top
shelves. And then the king would say, Good my lord, thou art aright; go
thou and do it. And I would go and do it.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Jack.</span></p>

<p>Would you have any whims?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Fopdoodle.</span></p>

<p>Wouldn’t I have whims!&mdash;Tom, my man, stand firm.&mdash;Thousands of them. If
a king and his lords can’t have their whims, they’re not so good as
other people are. Some day, when the king was in a right good humor, I
would say: Your valiant Majesty, an ape doth offend me much. I have a
whim. I crave a boon, my liege, a boon, my sovereign; and he would say,
I’ll grant it thee. Then I would say, I thank thee, good my sovereign. I
would that all the apes in thy kingdom were destroyed. And he would say,
Take this my signet ring, and let them perish.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Jack.</span></p>

<p>And you would kill poor Jack?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Fopdoodle.</span></p>

half-open, half-witted gate of a cousin. [<i>Aloud</i>] I’m in love. Help me,
Jack. About the king, good Jack, I was but joking; and if I were married
to Miss Violet, and were the king’s lord, I would not hurt a hair on an

I’m a sweet conundrum myself. Jack, you’re a stunning good fellow, an
awfully good ape. Let me stroke ape’s hair.</p>

<p>Sir Knight of the Horn of Plenty, did thy grand-uncle slay the Indians?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>All of them. The banks of the Mississippi were covered. He had hired
soldiers under him who harvested their scalps<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_90" id="page_90"></a>{90}</span> while he slew them. In my
life in Flatpuddle Smith’s Biography of Great Men, you will find him
given as my great collateral ancestor.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Thy family is warlike, but surely thou art a gentle knight.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I’m gentle now; but if one of those savage Indians rose up against
me, I’d heap this illustrated album of civilization, like a burning
coal, upon his head! Do you know, when I was in Europe they offered to
make me a reigning prince&mdash;if I’d pay for it. There were several vacant
thrones, and I was about making a bid, when my gigantic business
interests called me back to Cornville, and the throne fell through.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>When you were in Europe, did you visit Rome?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Passed through in the night-time, and didn’t stop. No business done
there; only a lot of fellows cutting figures in stone, and painting
pictures under the old masters.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>’Tis cruel in thee to jest so. Thy figure shows a gallant knight, and
thou dost speak by contraries to make thy showing finer. How doth the
moon shine in Europe?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_91" id="page_91"></a>{91}</span></p>

<p>’Tis very fair.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Why, there is the so-called fair moon now, sure enough! [<i>Looking at the

<p>The moon shines on thy armor, and thou thyself dost shine like a new tin
pan.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>There’s the new moon, the quarter moon, the full moon, and the dark of
the moon. The moon is good enough in its place.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Why, where is the moon’s place, if not in heaven?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>In the almanac.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Why, gallant knights and lovers gather substantial sustenance from
moonlight. ’Tis prescribed by Heaven and the poets. And thou revilest
the moon? Thou art a traitor to nature. Thy best place were in an

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span></p>

<p>Surely thou art the prince of jesters; and if ’tis thy humor, in part

kiss until she knows the true worth of it. Hast thou any castles in thy

<p>See, this is my stately dairy farm. Yonder pearly stream that through
the middle of the farm doth run and wind about, and then run in and out
as if ’twere playing tag between its wave-kissed banks, is called Pearl
Creek. It is a curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_95" id="page_95"></a>{95}</span> stream. Here, once, the wild goose, while he
plucked the toothsome grass from its banks of verdure, listened to an
Indian maid. Here, beneath this spacious sycamore, we’ll sit and fish
for speckled trout; I’ll bait the hook. And when ’tis winter we’ll skate
upon it. See yonder latticed arbor perched upon the bank: it is the
hen-house, with hens and their companions from many lands. Here will we
gather eggs through all the seasons; and to have fresh eggs in winter is
no mean luxury. See yonder moss-covered house of stone picturesquely
wading in the water. It is the milk-house, with all its crocks of golden
cream. Here, with sparkling water, without a murmur from the world,
we’ll fill our crocks of fortune to the brim. Here, amid these scenes of
thrift and beauty, bustling hens, pensive geese, lowing herds, crocks of
cream, and gleaming fishes, we’ll wander hand in hand, spending our
full-orbed honeymoon, while the rude outsiders stare in dreamy wonder at

of knowledge. I own the whole of it. Here’s my Cornville Eagle, which

<p>They who love moonlight must not forget the man in the moon; and I must
first ask my uncle. But I did not know that knights of late had grown so
rich. I must put on my spectacles.</p>

<p>That reminds me of the lightning-rod. [<i>Aside</i>] I’ll give her a sample

Whetstone, I wish to introduce into your community my patent flanged
galvanized lightning-rods. Said I to him, pointing to the steeple:
Eureka! Excelsior! Do you climb? Do you follow me? Do you donate? Is the
advertisement worth the rod? Will you spare the steeple, and spoil the
rod? He climbed. He donated. Before the next thunderstorm he received
orders for over forty rods from members who were afraid the lightning
would strike their property if they didn’t buy a rod.</p>

then I had thought more deeply. But now, alas! thy discovery comes too
late. I am a young judge, yet my sentence shall be a just one, and I’ll
not revoke it. Thou art a guileful knight. I sentence thee to perpetual
banishment; and that thou mayst study the phases of a maid’s heart and

not think so much upon the bloody deed, the grim and horrid spectacle.
Thinking cools me off like an evaporation; yet truly there is a manifold
vigor in me, O dazzling Violet, else why am I so brave when heated? Fire
brings out my bravery. What is the coward quality that on a sudden
chokes my valor so? I have it: it comes of too much thinking. Let me
pluck it out.&mdash;But no, I cannot pluck out my brains; yet I will admonish
my head not to think so much. But still, thinking is wisdom; therefore
too much wisdom makes me a thinking coward. I must cultivate less
wisdom. O dazzling Violet! I’ll send him a challenge, and he’ll not
fight. A bloodless triumph. Now thinking comes to my rescue. Animals
have not this process of thinking, for I have seen terrible animals
fight ferociously until they were dead, dead. O dazzling Violet!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_105" id="page_105"></a>{105}</span>

<p>[<i>Aside</i>] Oh, he is ze grand American lover!</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>Ninon, in Paris were you ever courted,&mdash;that is to say, were you ever in

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>Give me simplicity! O Love, the entangler, do not unravel us! Let no

<p>Très beau! Good Monsieur Rainbow, ze frog is ze great beau in ze
springtime, with his fine green coat and gold buttons.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>Now I remember me, the frog has a gallant look when the spring is in the
meadows and the banks are grassy. Now I remember me more closely, he
also has a romantic look; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108"></a>{108}</span> once, when a boy, I watched him sitting,
like a sybarite Turk, upon a dewy bank in the pale moonlight, enjoying
the downward fragrance of an o’erbending lily, which o’er him hung like
a wedding bell. He gazed upon the moon sailing above him, and then upon
the moon below him, glistening in the pond which was his bed,&mdash;Neptune’s
trundle-bed, made for frogs,&mdash;until, between these two perplexities of
light, his eyes like diamonds shone. Shall I halt here?</p>

<p class="c">
<span class="smcap">Scythe</span> <i>looks at the earth and moon alternately with his glass</i>.<br />

interest. His eyes shone like ze diamonds, ze beautiful diamonds.
Superbe!</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>Well, his eyes, like twin solitaires encrusted in rims of red gold,
shone more translucently than any that e’er sparkled in the betrothal
ring of an expectant bride. It seems this gentleman in green had grown
fixedly practical between the real moon and the ideal moon, and would
not have an ideal when he had not the real; for he, poor frog, like some
of our practical humans, did not know that the ideal moon in a pond was
much finer than a pond in the real moon. Now do I see him, as plainly as
if it were to-night, there coolly sitting and meditating, quite
philosophical.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_109" id="page_109"></a>{109}</span></p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Ninon.</span></p>

philosophy. Ah, Major Bluegrass, you have ze fervent language zat
thrills me.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>Dear Ninon, my description, like your own pretty costume with all its
frills, tucks, and love-knots, has a moral with it. Before this
philosophic gentleman in green had reconciled himself to an ideal, a
flying cloud curtained the moon; and thus in his philosophy he let
bright opportunity slip, and went dark below.</p>

<p class="c"><span class="smcap">Scythe</span> <i>discontinues using glass</i>.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Ninon.</span></p>

<p>Oui, oui; too true. I pity ze poor froggie.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>Dear Ninon, render him no pity; for although I was but a green boy, I
then resolved that opportunity was greater than philosophy. Ninon,
yonder glorious moon shines brightly as on that memorable night in the
meadows. ’Tis a bright opportunity; let me kiss thee again.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Ninon.</span></p>

<p>Pardon, sweet Monsieur Rainbow; wait for ze grand opportunity when ze
honeymoon upon our wedding shines; then you shall have ze thousand
kisses. Charmant!</p>

enemy in diction, I at last chose dictionaries, big and unabridged, and
made by the most celebrated word-smiths.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Dictionaries! Did you say dictionaries? Major, now my anger is reviving.
Now, by all that’s terrible, I’ll fight till there’s not a leaf or lid

and Fopdoodle, each aided by his respective second, will each
respectively select, for each fire from his inexhaustible dictionary or
armory, one animal noun for his projectile, and one adjective,&mdash;for your
adjective is your gunpowder to your bullet of a noun. These two, to wit:
one animal noun and one adjective, each of you will form into a
cartridge, or epithet, and at the word <i>Fire</i> each will fire it at his
adversary.</p>

<p>Upon what purely scientific facts do you now perch your alleged fowl?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>Upon the rail between bull and frog. Bull-frog is a compound animal
noun, composed of one bull and one frog, connected by a hyphen, or
narrow ligament, like the Siamese twins,&mdash;two animals in one. I ask
judgment.</p>

<p class="r">
[<i>Lightning and thunder.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Scythe.</span></p>

<p>Listen to my decision; for though it should rain bull-frogs, I’ll decide
by analysis. The difference lies between the grammatical bull-frog and
the purely animal bull-frog. Grammar does not concern the animal
bull-frog, but has much to do with the word bull-frog. The purely animal
bull-frog is manifestly not a fowl; but inasmuch as by the rules only
one animal noun is allowed at a shot, and whereas the grammatical
bull-frog is compounded of two animals linked by a hyphen, I declare
them a chain-shot, disallowed in civilized warfare, and a foul of the
worst description.</p>

<p>A day and night,&mdash;and now another day hath waned for our recuperation;
and our adventures have flown on lightning wings to Cornville. Now do we
start on new emprise.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Major Bluegrass, this serenade must be played on the hard-pan. Put me
through to-night, and I’ll make you half-owner of the Cornville Eagle.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>Trust me, I’ll be your musical secretary! With the Eagle and Ninon, I
could soar through life like a bird.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>And I’ll soar with Violet. Why, hello! I’ve forgotten all about Susan.
Where’ll I leave Susan?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_140" id="page_140"></a>{140}</span></p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>Susan! Your housekeeper! Why, what takes you back to Cornville at such a
sky-crisis as this? The great point in a flight of romance is never to
approach earth. Susan! Why, Susan will tarry here below and superintend
the cuisine, so that you and Violet may have a warm repast when you come
down from your sky-parlor.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>I wonder what Susan will say when I bring home my bride.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>As one good man should say to another, first bridle your bride.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>Why, Major, Susan and I were young together, and we loved, or thought we
did. She wanted to marry, I wanted to wait; consequence, compromise. I
engaged her as my housekeeper. There’s romance for you!</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>’Tis an ancient parallel.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>In our serenade, what shall I do?</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Bluegrass.</span></p>

<p>The guitar you hold you cannot play; hence I’ll do the mechanical upon
the strings, while you twit the circumambient<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_141" id="page_141"></a>{141}</span> air from the bridge
musical of your instrument. And if you’d prove me with a double burden,
I’ll bear both words and music; in which event you’ll give the color and
visible gesture of description. Stand you beneath some close-leaved
tree, where the night overlaps, and I’ll be concealed near you in the
shrubbery. Later, I’ll emerge behind you, as your true shadow.</p>

<p class="cpers"><span class="smcap">Whetstone.</span></p>

<p>All right, I’ll give the motions. Now, let’s see what we have in the
song-book. [<i>Opening song-book.</i>] Here’s the Midnight Serenade; and
Beauteous Lady I Adore Thee. That’s business. Here’s a whole grist of

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
